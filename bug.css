The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there's a common mistake when using it with percentages. For example, `width: calc(50% + 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% + 10%);` might not produce the desired result. This is because the second percentage is calculated relative to the width itself, leading to an infinite loop (as the width depends on its own calculation).
